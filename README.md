# Scaleborn
### This is a Minecraft 1.12.2 Forge Modpack that mostly revolves around things that have scales, power generation, and cool trinkets and items.
# Installation
### Follow these instructions to install the modpack.

First you need to have java installed. You can download an installer [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). Make sure you grab a 64-bit version for whatever operating system you are using.

Now use the forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2847-installer.jar file to install the client.
#### MAKE SURE THE "Install Client" BUTTON IS SELECTED.

Once forge is installed, navigate to the .minecraft directory and insert the mods, Flan, and config folders provided.*

After inserting the mods, start your minecraft launcher and select "1.12.2-forge1.12.2-14.23.5.2847" in the drop-down box to the left of the play button, then click play.**

### Congrats! You can now play Scaleborn!


*One way to get to .minecraft is to press Windows + r buttons, type in
%appdata%/.minecraft and press enter.

**If you encounter a java heap problem, you need to increase the amount of ram you allocate. In the minecraft launcher select the Installations tab at the top, hover over the "1.12.2-forge1.12.2-14.23.5.2847" version and click the three dot button on the right then click edit. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select "MORE OPTIONS" and find JVM arguments box. At the beginning you should see something like "-Xmx#G", where # is a number representing the allocated gigabytes of RAM for minecraft. Change the number to whatever amount of RAM you want (I usually do about 3/4 of my computers RAM), then click save. You should now be able to use the modpack.

If you still have problems, please submit them to the github page with any relevant
error log information.
