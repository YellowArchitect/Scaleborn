# Scaleborn
### This is a Minecraft 1.12.2 Forge Modpack that mostly revolves around things that have scales, power generation, and cool trinkets and items.
# Installation
### Follow these instructions to install the modpack.

First you need to have java installed. You can download an installer [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp). Make sure you grab a 64-bit version for whatever operating system you are using.

Now use the Scaleborn-Install.bat file to create a new folder in .minecraft and install forge to the client.*
#### MAKE SURE THE "Install Client" RADIO BUTTON IS SELECTED WHEN INSTALLING FORGE.

After installing forge, start the minecraft launcher, select the Installations tab and create a new installation.
Name the installation whatever you want, but for VERSION select "release 1.12.2-forge1.12.2-14.23.5.2855" in the drop-down box and set GAME DIRECTORY to Scaleborn, located in AppData\Roaming\.minecraft.
You will want increase your allocated ram. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select "MORE OPTIONS" and find JVM arguments box. At the beginning you should see something like "-Xmx#G", where # is a number representing the allocated gigabytes of RAM for minecraft. Change the number to whatever amount of RAM you want (I usually do about 3/4 of my computers RAM), then click Create in the bottome right corner.**

### Congrats! You can now play Scaleborn!


*If the .bat file doesn't work, you can do thing manually. You need to copy the mods and config folders included in this downloaded and paste them in a new folder named Scaleborn in the .minecraft folder. One way to get to .minecraft is to press Windows + r buttons, type in %appdata%/.minecraft and press enter. Once you do this, launch the forge-1.12.2-1.12.2-14.23.5.2855-installer.jar file and continue follwing the instructions above as normal.

**If you encounter a java heap problem, you need to increase the amount of ram you allocate, or may simply need a more powerful computer.

If you still have problems, please submit them to the github page with any relevant
error log information.
